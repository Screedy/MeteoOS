This is my bachelor's thesis project. It is about a comparative analysis of dynamic and static programming languages for the development of applications on microcontrollers. Specifically, it focuses on the languages C++ and MicroPython, which represent the static and dynamic languages in this domain, respectively. The aim of the thesis was to assess how both languages cope with the challenges associated with development on microcontrollers, including ease of implementation, debugging, performance, and the quality of the resulting application.
